A set of toy/template GEGL filters.
And a containerized build environment for same.

Work in progress. For education, not production quality.
The artifacts of my learning exercise.

## About this repo

My original goal was to write the Canny filter in GEGL, 
to learn how to write GEGL filters.

To start, I set up a containerized build environment.
Then I built some GEGL filters from tutorials.
Then created a set of template plugins for GEGL filters
of various classes (meta, point, area.)

Then I ported the Canny filter (a useful, well-known algorithm) to GEGL.
Canny is a sequence of more primitive operations.
Which fits the GEGL meta filter model.
The Canny filter is not in the GEGL project's set of filters.
Some of its primitive operations are (blur and sobel image-gradient.)
I wrote the missing primitive operations in GEGL
(non-max-suppression, double-threshold, hysteresis)

Elsewhere, Canny is implemented in Python with numpy,
or in pure C but not using any other libraries such as GEGL/OpenCL,
or in C using openCL.
There are suprising many implementations.
Which I borrowed from.
Each implementation uses slightly different terms and algorithms.

Also an experiment using AI for coding.
Much of the code and comments were generated by Copilot.
I curated them, but they might be wrong.
I did not ensure the final code and comments are correct.

## Usage

After you build and install the set of plugins
(Canny and three primitives it needs)
then run GIMP and choose Tools>GEGL Operations.
You will see and you can test the Canny filter.

## Building

I build using Vagga and the vagga.yaml script in the repo.

To build without using Vagga containers,
read the vagga.yaml.
It documents the dependencies and meson commands.
